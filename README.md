Analysis Updates: 
During the analysis phase of our project, certain parts of our research needed further work so that more useful data could be extracted. Here are the changes we made:
More detail on Injury Trends: Our initial analysis mainly concentrated on general injury trends within a specified period of time. However, a closer look made us realize the importance of singling out particular increase and decrease in injuries, especially in pivotal years like 2014. As such, this development forced us to fine-tune our approach in identifying possible causal factors behind these upswings and downswings.
Exploration of Resting Protocols: One finding from our study was the apparent positive change in player load management and resting protocols with time. In this regard, there was therefore a need for further inquiry into evolving strategies used by teams to curb injury occurrence thereby probably suggesting how effective these protocols may be.
Conducted a Case Study on Golden State Warriors: Although our initial analysis gave valuable insights about league-wide injury trends, it was important to do a specific case study to deepen our understanding. The case study from 2015-2020 involving the Golden State Warriors provided an opportunity to examine how injuries relate to a team’s success along with illuminating various aspects concerning their franchise as a whole.





Design + Visualization Packages
Visual 1 (Injuries Trend over the Decade): The first graph shows us the trend of injuries over time in the NBA and this represents a general decline with an outstanding increase in 2014. 
Package: Altair

Visual 2 (Injury Management Improvements): The graph shows that injuries occur for different teams over the decade. i.e. there is no consistent leader in injuries so we can assume that teams can't predict injuries based on their style of play or culture.
Package: Altair

Visual 3 (Pace, Injuries, and Playoff Impact): The third graph looks at pace, injury count and year-by-year playoff admission to show there is a slightly negative correlation between pace and injury.
Package: plotly (graph_objects)

Visual 4 (Seasonal Trends in Injuries): The fourth graph illustrates seasonal trends of injuries across an NBA season and some insights from a case study of Golden State Warriors.
Package: Altair and analysis with mathplotlib

Visual 5 (Playoff Admission & True Shooting Percentage): The fifth graph examines the interrelation between playoff admission, injury count, and True Shooting Percentage (TS%).
Package: Plotly (express)

Strengths: 
Our project is very cohesive. We were able to make something with all of our analysis, even if we couldn’t find a direct correlation and tie it all together at the end.
 The visualizations give tons of information that could lead to their own separate analysis projects on their own. We did a good job of finding key information in the graphs and using those to draw our conclusions.
 We were persistent in our analysis until we came up with something interesting that we could share.
Challenges:
The analysis stage was difficult, as the amount we could do was infinite. However, we reduced the scale enough to make compelling visualizations.
 The visualizations took a lot of debugging because there was very specific information that we wanted to share that we had to figure out how to display in the most efficient manner.
 Using the interactions in a way that wasn’t just for show was difficult since our information could usually be displayed with a simple graph - the interactions made us expand our mode of thinking and look at our problem from multiple points of view.
Advice (Next-generation students in CS 329E): 
 Use a basketball reference to get your data. They have millions of data sets that are 100% accurate that are there to be analyzed.
 Find a good way to reduce the scale of the project early. We jumped back and forth with the project because our visions was too large to complete given the time constraint
 Be flexible with your analysis. It’s common to find no correlation in your data. That’s fine, injuries tend to be pretty random anyway, just continue with the analysis and answering questions until something comes to light.
Look into past research and see if you can find any similarities or correlations between your research to see if other sources are backing up your claims.
